#Prerequisites

In order to use this codebase you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

## Terraform

This code has been applied with terraform version **0.15**. 

It theory it should work with any version > 0.12, but it has been tested with 0.15 only.

### Download terraform

Please follow the instructions on [terraform official page and download terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for your operating system.

> **Note:** Please note that this guide is Unix-centric, so you better Use Linux or MacOS.

### Install terraform

You can follow the terraform [installation instructions available here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

## AWS-ClI

In addition to terraform you need to install the latest version of the AWS CLI (**v2**) as per [the following guideline available on the AWS docs site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

## AWS-SSO-Util

As Cinepolis are using AWS SSO, and as the ```aws sso login``` coming with the aws cli has some minor limitations we utilize the [aws-sso-util](https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-util).

Please follow the [Quickstart installation and set up instructions guide on their github page](https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-util/blob/master/README.md#quickstart).

## Awsume

To switch between accounts we use the ```awsume``` tool. 

> **Note:** It's a prerequisite for the [terraform_deploy.sh script](../scripts/terraform_deploy.sh) together with terraform.

## Additional information

For convenience, we are providing a pre-generated ```~/.aws/config``` credentials file which could be used by all tools above and is ready to go. 
The only thing you need here is to add it to your ```~/.aws/config``` file as is. 

It's available in the [files](../files) section and it's named [aws_sso_profiles](../files/aws_sso_profiles). The file has been generated by using the ```aws-sso-util``` populate command:

```aws-sso-util configure populate```
